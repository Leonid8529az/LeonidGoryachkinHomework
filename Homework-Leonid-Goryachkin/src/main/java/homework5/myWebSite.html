<h1>Self Driving Car</h1>
<h3>A self-driving car, also known as an autonomous vehicle (AV), driverless car, or robotic car (robo-car)</h3>
<p>
    Is a car incorporating vehicular automation, that is, a ground vehicle that is capable of sensing its
    environment and moving safely with little or no human input. The future of this technology may
    have an impact on multiple industries and other circumstances.

    Self-driving cars combine a variety of sensors to perceive their surroundings, such as thermographic
    cameras, radar, lidar, sonar, GPS, odometry and inertial measurement units. Advanced control
    systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles
    and relevant signage.

    Possible implementations of the technology include personal self-driving vehicles, shared robotaxis,
    and connected vehicle platoons. Several projects to develop a fully self-driving commercial car
    are in various stages of development, but there are no self-driving cars available for everyday consumers.

    <div class = "levels">
    <ul><h3>There are several levels of automated cars</h3></ul>
    <li><span style ="border: 2px solid black">"mechanics"</span> The automated system issues warnings and may momentarily intervene but has no sustained vehicle
        control.</li>
    <li><span style ="border: 2px solid black">"hands on"</span> The driver and the automated system share control of the vehicle</li>
    <li><span style ="border: 2px solid black">"hands off"</span> The automated system takes full control of the vehicle: accelerating, braking, and
        steering. The driver must monitor the driving and be prepared to intervene immediately at any time
        if the automated system fails to respond properly.</li>
    <li><span style ="border: 2px solid black">"eyes off"</span> The driver can safely turn their attention away from the driving tasks, e.g. the
        driver can text or watch a film. The vehicle will handle situations that call for an immediate
        response, like emergency braking. The driver must still be prepared to intervene within some
        limited time</li>
    <li><span style ="border: 2px solid black">"mind off"</span> As level 3, but no driver attention is ever required for safety, e.g. the
        driver may safely go to sleep or leave the driver's seat. However, self-driving is supported only
        in limited spatial areas or under special circumstances.</li>
    <li><span style ="border: 2px solid black">"steering wheel optional"</span> No human intervention is required at all. An example would be a
        robotic vehicle that works on all kinds of surfaces, all over the world, all year around, in all
        weather conditions.</li>
